Ellis Recruitment embarked on a radical digital marketing strategy to solve two big problems they faced as a specialist recruiter for the construction industry:

1. **Attracting leads from the construction industry**, which on average is not digitally savvy
2. **Finding staff to fill these roles**, while the construction industry is facing a severe shortage of candidates

Before this project, Ellis Recruitment had never automatically generated incoming leads from their website, or any other channel - something that is common across the recruitment industry, according to company director Natalie Ellis.

> "When I started in recruitment I was always told I would never get incoming leads, but today I can say Tom has proven that theory wrong."

## How we built a system that continues to generate leads... without lifting a finger.

We were given the freedom to use any strategy necesary to reach our goals of finding clients and candidates for the company, provided it was cost-effective.

We developed a complete end-to-end system that achieved the following:

1. **Attracted construction clients while they were actively looking for staff**. We used Google Adwords, and maintained these accounts so the ad spend became more effective every week, improving the ads and targeting until they were a perfect match for our audience.
2. **Made them an offer they couldn't refuse.** We crafted a fantastic landing page, using the latest in web psychology to tempt clients to sign up and finally find the new staff they desparately need.
3. **Automatically built a relationship so they became customers.** When people sign up, we send a series of automated emails with a personal touch that show people why Ellis Recruitment is different.

A similar system was developed for candidates who are looking for roles.

## The result: A cost-effective stream of hot leads who want to do business, every day

Here's what Ellis Recruitment director Natalie has to say:

>"All I can say is wow! Tom has set up a system for my business which **generates incoming leads without me having to lift a finger**. These are **hot leads from companies who want to do business with us**. And the best part is now that the system is set up, **it will continue to work without me having to do anything**. It is really cost effective too! I have NEVER in recruitment seen incoming leads like this, so it is absolutely amazing to see! In a short space of time we have gained new clients for a small investment. - Natalie Ellis, Director

We still love seeing Ellis Recruitment get multiple leads every day, months after we finished building this system for their company.

We've proven that we can do it for an industry that everyone said "doesn't do digital."

Imagine what can we do for your industry.
