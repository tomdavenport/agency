## Your website is leaking money. Google Analytics shows you where.

Do you know how many leads or sales your website made last month?

Do you know how many it _lost_ last month?

Almost every business we meet has the same problem. They've invested a lot of time and money in their website, but don't know exactly what return it's making for their business.

### Problems with Google Analytics

Your website probably has [Google Analytics][6] installed. That's a good start, it's our favourite analytics too. But out-the-box, Google Analytics has some serious problems you might not know about.

* **The website traffic numbers are inaccurate without setup.** You need to filter out spam traffic from hackers who fake your traffic numbers, making them useless. Accurate website analytics reveal the *true* picture of what's happening on your website, so we can find real opportunities.
* **Your business goals aren't being tracked.** We can set analytics to track when contact forms are submitted, orders are placed, when PDFs are downloaded and much more. Is your business doing this? If so, are you improving your website and marketing ROI based on that data?
* **Powerful hidden features aren't turned on.** We could be building audiences of prospects who visited certain pages, at the flip of a switch. We could see what visitors search for, and learn what they're _really_ looking for we can serve it to them. This is the secret to high-engagement websites.
* **There's no way to see your top KPIs at-a-glance.** Business owners need simple top-line stats, but Google Analytics hides these in obscure places across many pages full of jargon. We give you a way to collect your main KPIs in one simple dashboard, which can be shared with your team and directors.

Google Analytics is a powerful tool for growth, and you're missing out on it.

When potential customers leave your website, it's money being left on the table.

You're going to be one of the few businesses who solve this, and get an unfair advantage against the competition. Take your business intelligence to the next level and get pin-sharp measurement on your website now, before it's too late.

## We set up your website analytics and give you actionable insights to grow your business.

Here's some of the ways we can help.

### Clear out fake traffic

Simple housekeeping will clean out those fake visits from automated spam bots. We'll set up comprehensive spam filters so you're only tracking real people who come to your site.

### Track business goals

Analytics Goals let you measure when a lead or sale comes through the site. **You can see which marketing channels are bringing in those leads and sales** - and see with confidence what ROI you're getting from your digital marketing spend.

We track two kinds of goals;  big-win **macro goals** like leads and sales, and **micro goals** like downloading PDFs or social media clicks. All of these build a picture of what drives the higest transaction values and gets the greatest lifetime value from your prospects.

### Unlock hidden Google Analytics features

We'll turn on all of Google Analytics' best hidden features. The best one gives you the option to target website visitors with banner advertising on _other_ websites in the future. We call this *retargeting* (we're also big fans of [Facebook retargeting](http://localhost:4000/facebook-retargeting-ads/ "How Facebook Retargeting Multiplies Your ROI"). Retargeting is the most cost-effective adveritsing method available today.

### A customised KPI dashboard

Finally, we'll bring your most important KPIs and trend graphs into one simple dashboard. No more getting lost in all those complicated analytics pages; we'll give you an actionable dashboard to check in on and share with your team.
