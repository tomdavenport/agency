Anyone can access them in just 10 minutes... and yet, so many businesses struggle with social media marketing.

You probably see companies hire lower-level staff to "do social media" - then find they don't have a strategy, and just know some theory by "blogging gurus" instead of experience running successful campaigns.

The end result of a poor strategy can be gimmicky, and in-your-face. You need to put ads in front of the right people at the right time.

It's no secret how to win at Facebook - thousands of businesses (and soon, your competitors) will be winning at Facebook advertising. You can build your strategy online for guides, but if you can't translate techno-jargon into action, your business will be at a loss and won't know what to do next.

### Knowing how to make a Facebook ad isn't enough. You need a *strategy.*

With a robust strategy, any business can get a positive ROI from Facebook marketing. We can help you work out the potential, 1000

The first thing we do is look at whether Facebook advertising is for you.

There's a perception that Facebook is only for consumer-facing B2C companies. It's true that Facebook is *perfect* for reaching consumers. Probably the best platform in the world. Businesses, however, need to ask themselves this question:

***Do you have a clear profile of who your business customers are?***

If your customers can be grouped into clear profiles, a Facebook marketing strategy *works*.

You *can* have a powerful presence on social media, because Facebook costs *so little* to advertise. It feels like a golden opportunity in the history of marketing.

## Facebook advertising lets you attract and engage loyal customers by reaching thousands of highly targeted prospects.

Show us what your ideal customers looks like, and we will show you how to get new customers from Facebook and get a great return on your investment.

Your business how to master the new strategies and techniques of successful Facebook advertising:

1. Reach them in ways that get them enthused about your company
2. 'Retarget' the best prospects and convert them on your site
3. Pinpoint your most profitable audience and scale up.

## Testimonial

### How does Facebook advertising compare to Google Adwords?

If you're familiar with Google Adwords, this comparison will get you up to speed.

#### Google Adwords is great when...

Your customers are looking for something specific in that moment. They jump onto Google to find a solution, and you can put your offer in front of them at the perfect time.

If this is better for you, we also offer a Google Adwords Setup service.

#### Facebook Advertising is great when...

You have a defined audience, but they don't necesarily know they need your service yet. Facebook is far better at putting your offer in front of the *right kind of people*. It's also far cheaper per click than Google Adwords.
