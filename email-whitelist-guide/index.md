Email companies do a great job of blocking “spam” emails, but they can be a bit too trigger happy.

Let’s make sure you receive all our emails with these 10-second guides:

## Select your email client

- [Gmail]({{site.url}}/email-whitelist-guide/gmail/ "How to whitelist emails in Gmail")

- [Outlook]({{site.url}}/email-whitelist-guide/outlook/ "How to whitelist emails in Outlook")
