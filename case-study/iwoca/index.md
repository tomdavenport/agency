## Growing search traffic in an extremely competitive industry

iwoca is an online business credit website. They offer simple direct loans to businesses, with no hidden fees.

Financial lending is a competitive space. While iwoca already uses extensive digital marketing strategies (that have helped it earn tens of millions in funding from investors), it wanted innovative new ideas to expand its online prescene, and so it turned to Digital Marketing Specialist.

### What iwoca said about our SEO strategy

> "We brought Tom on board to help us set up a content and SEO strategy and get us started with implementation. He was an **invaluable support** in all regards. In particular his knowledge on useful tools and tricks was a big help as was his experience in modern SEO techniques such as guest-blogging (i.e. no black magic). We're now live with a much broader set of content (including guides, landing pages and blog posts) and **have started seeing positive results in search rankings**." - Piece Glennie, Chief Marketing Officer, iwoca
