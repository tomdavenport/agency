When opening an email message, a “+” symbol should display next to From: and the sender’s name. Select this and an “Add to contacts” pop-up should appear. Select “Save”:

1. Open your inbox, and find an email from us. It will have **@digitalmarketingspecialist.co.uk** in the address.
2. Right-click the email and select **"Junk Email > Add Sender to Safe Senders List"**.<br> !()[whitelist-outlook.jpg]<br>

Now you'll see your emails when they arrive!
