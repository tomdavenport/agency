## Master the strategies of successful facebook advertising, and reach thousands of highly targeted prospects on the most powerful new ad platform in the world.

Did you know [1.5 billion people use Facebook *every day?*](http://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/ "Facebook Statistics")

You can reach specific, targeted segments of them in just 10 minutes... and yet, so many businesses ignore social media marketing.

Some companies who at least try to get involved will just hire lower-level staff to "do social media" - then find they don't have a strategy, and just know some theory by "blogging gurus" instead of experience running successful campaigns.

The end result of a poor strategy can be gimmicky, and in-your-face.

The trick to successful campaigns with a rock-bottom cost-per-aquisition is to put ads in front of the right people at the right time.

Thousands of businesses (and soon, your competitors) will be winning at Facebook advertising. You can build your strategy online by reading guides for a few months and testing what works. Just remember, if you try to build Facebook campaigns yourself but can't translate techno-jargon from online guides into action, it could cost you dearly.

Or you can go straight to an expert, who know how to kick start a successful campaign from day one. That's where we come in!

The first thing we do is look at whether Facebook advertising is for you.

There's a perception that Facebook is only for consumer-facing B2C companies. It's true that Facebook is *perfect* for reaching consumers. Probably the best platform in the world. Businesses, however, need to ask themselves this question:

## Do you have a clear profile of who your business customers are?

If your customers can be grouped into clear profiles, a Facebook marketing strategy *works*.

You *can* have a powerful presence on social media, because Facebook costs *so little* to advertise. It feels like a golden opportunity in the history of marketing.

## Testimonial

### How does Facebook advertising compare to Google Adwords?

If you're familiar with Google Adwords, this comparison will get you up to speed.

#### Google Adwords is great when...

Your customers are looking for something specific in that moment. They jump onto Google to find a solution, and you can put your offer in front of them at the perfect time.

If this is better for you, we also offer a Google Adwords Setup service.

#### Facebook Advertising is great when...

You have a defined audience, but they don't necesarily know they need your service yet. Facebook is far better at putting your offer in front of the *right kind of people*. It's also far cheaper per click than Google Adwords.
