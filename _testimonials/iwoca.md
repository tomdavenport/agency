We brought Tom on board to help us set up a content and SEO strategy and get us started with implementation. He was an invaluable support in all regards. In particular his knowledge on useful tools and tricks was a big help as was his experience in modern SEO techniques such as guest-blogging (i.e. no black magic). We're now live with a much broader set of content (including guides, landing pages and blog posts) and have started seeing positive results in search rankings.
