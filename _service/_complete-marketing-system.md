# A Complete Digital Marketing Solution

## How to get endless leads and a guaranteed ROI with one simple website strategy

You know the internet can attract business. After all, everyone else seems to be doing it.

You just don’t know where to start.

If you spend too long trying the wrong things out, it could be months before something sticks… and then a few more months before the next tactic works.

What you need is a **complete digital marketing system**.

Other marketers just bring extra traffic, but that’s the easy part. A complete digital marketing system brings in more leads, has more of them become customers, and helps you get get more value from them by nudging them with up-sells in the future… all without you lifting a finger.

[Chart]

This is a system that thousands of online businesses are using successfully, and you can have it too.

It’s based on the same system McDonalds and other international corporates use to get more value from customers. “Do you want fries with that?” We’re going to take lessons like this and apply it to your digital operation, because this is the best way to make the internet work for you.


### Developing this system wasn’t easy. 

I’ve invested thousands of pounds and years of front-line training to get here:

- £2,416 on Digital Marketing courses on online advertising, landing page design, email marketing and content strategy
- £1,600 on conversion rate training from the global leading expert, Peep Laja, so I know how to make people buy more from a webpage
- £253 per month (!) on cutting-edge digital marketing software that gives me the edge on customer research, competitor insights, landing pages and search engine tracking
- 7+ years of experience writing premium content, making my way to some of the biggest websites in the world like the Guardian, Wired and CNET
- 4+ years in marketing, starting from the bottom of an agency and working my way up to running an international consultancy for companies worth up to £110 million per year

I remember being in the same position as you. I had lots of ideas, and knew the internet was the place to make them happen… but no idea where to start.

### Years later, I’ve finally mapped out an effortless digital marketing system, and it runs like a perfectly oiled machine.

At one end, we increase the number of visitors.

We impress them by giving value and building trust.

At the other end, you get hot leads who want your business. 

In fact, by the time you hear about them, they’ve already handed you money to get started.

### You could have this machine running for your business in one month.

Within just one day of going live, you’ll be getting fresh traffic into your marketing machine. It’s normal to be getting active leads for new business in your first week, if not by the second day.

How do we get so much traffic instantly? Because we buy it from ad networks. The cost is worth it, because the machine is designed to pay for itself. You invest a smaller amount at the start, and get a bigger amount at the end, like any good business.

This repeats over and over, without any extra effort - it just works.

### Picture this. 

It’s a Monday morning, and you’re tasting your favourite breakfast, and check your phone.

What do you see?

You received three fresh notifications for bookings overnight.

As you make your way to your work desk, your phone buzzes again. It’s another booking. This is all automatic. Your marketing is done - you’ve checked it off. More time to focus on serving those customers and growing your business. Think how much time that will save. 

And imagine the relief that you’ve got a steady stream of business coming in, because you invested in a real strategy that works.

## 100% Money-Back Guarantee

I’ve proven this system works.

If, for some reason, you don’t generate new business, I will keep testing and improving your system for free until it starts working for you.

If you aren’t getting leads within 60 days of the system going live, you can have 100% of your money back. 

Let me tell you why I offer this guarantee.

When I started out working at a regular marketing agency, I couldn’t believe how they would try and sell the same old, tired, rehashed, “quick win” tactics. Tactics that would sometimes work… but usually fail.

That wasn’t good enough for me, or the customers who were paying.

That’s why I’ve invested thousands of pounds of my own money and years of my life into developing a strategic system that covers every base: quickly attracting leads, expertly warming them up, measurably increasing sales, and proving ROI at every step.

That is why I consult for international companies worth hundreds of millions. And that is why I guarantee your complete digital marketing system will generate serious leads for your business.

It’s simple: if the system isn’t getting leads within 60 days of going live, I’ll refund you 100%.
