## Transforming an ecommerce store in just 3 months

Our client Dee Set had been years trying to attract cost-effective clicks, with a disappointing ROI close to 1.2x. In an attempt to radically improve the situation, Dee Set launched a new version of the website in Spring 2015 and appointed Digital Marketing Specialist to improve its advertising ROI, starting with its flagship travel kettle product.

### How we improved ROI with Google Adwords

To improve advertising ROI, we blocked irrelevant keywords that were causing unnecessary spend. We optimised the kettle product page, which helps reduce the cost-per-click. We increased the store's overall conversion rate by increasing ease through the buying experience. We set up a means to collect emails to increase the lifetime value of each customer, and also launched a simple eBay store to boost revenue.

## The result: 6x more online revenue

### Conversion Rate up 509%

### Advertising ROI up 345%

By July 2015, Travel Store Direct was generating 6x the revenue and has increased its advertising conversion rate from 2% to 6.6%. We have now expanded to advertising all products on the Google Shopping network, where the ROI is 4.9x and growing every week as we make ongoing improvements to the website. In addition, the additional eBay store is selling over 200+ products every week at no advertising cost.

>"We didn't believe PPC was an effective channel, based on previous experience. **Tom showed us a strategy for reducing the spend and increasing sales, and that's exactly what he did**. His technical ability has added serious value to our operation." - *Neil Latham, Manager, Travel Store Direct*
