## Master the strategies of successful facebook advertising, and reach thousands of highly targeted prospects on the most powerful ad platform in the world.

**Fact:** Facebook has over 1.5 billion people use Facebook *every day*.

You can access them in just 10 minutes... and yet, so many people are struggling with social media marketing.

I often see companies hire entry-level staff to "do social media". These kids don't have a strategy, and their education is based on theory by "blogging gurus" who have little practical experience.

They sometimes don't even know you can pay pennies to reach specific, targeted audiences... and instead, keep shouting in the wind with boring status updates.

The end result is often too gimmicky, and too much in-your-face.

You could search online for guides, but if you can't translate techno-jargon into action, your business will be at a loss with what to do next.

### Knowing how to make a Facebook ad isn't enough. You need a *strategy.*

The first thing we do is take a hard look at whether Facebook advertising is for you.

There's a perception that Facebook is only for consumer-facing B2C companies. It's true that Facebook is *perfect* for reaching consumers. Probably the best platform in the world. Businesses, however, need to ask themselves this question:

***Do you have a clear profile of who your business customers are?***

If your customers can be grouped into clear profiles, a Facebook marketing strategy *works*.

You *can* have a powerful presence on social media, because Facebook costs *so little* to advertise. It feels like a golden opportunity in the history of marketing.

## Facebook advertising lets you attract and engage loyal customers by reaching thousands of highly targeted prospects.

Show me what your ideal customers looks like, and I will show you how to get new customers from Facebook and get a great return on your investment.

Your business how to master the new strategies and techniques of successful Facebook advertising:

1. Reach them in ways that get them enthused about your company
2. 'Retarget' the best prospects and convert them on your site
3. Pinpoint your most profitable audience and scale up.

**The result: Increased web traffic and sales.**

This kind of knowledge could save you a lot of trouble and money.

- Are new to Facebook advertising

My ultimate goal is for you to gain dramatically on your investment.

## Testimonial

### How does Facebook advertising compare to Google Adwords?

If you're familiar with Google Adwords, this comparison will get you up to speed.

#### Google Adwords is great when...

Your customers are looking for something specific in that moment. They jump onto Google to find a solution, and you can put your offer in front of them at the perfect time.

If this is better for you, I also offer a Google Adwords Setup service.

#### Facebook Advertising is great when...

You have a defined audience, but they don't necesarily know they need your service yet. Facebook is far better at putting your offer in front of the *right kind of people*. It's also far cheaper per click than Google Adwords.
