## Your website is leaking money. Analytics shows you where.

Do you know how many leads or sales your website made last month?

Do you know how many it *lost* last month?

Almost every business I meet has the same problem. They've invested a lot of time and money in their website, but don't know exactly what return it's making for their business.

### The problem with Google Analytics

Your website probably has [Google Analytics](http://analytics.google.com "Google Analytics") installed. That's a good start, it's my favourite analytics too. But out-the-box, Google Analytics has some serious problems you don't know about.

- **The website traffic numbers are inaccurate.** You need to filter out spam traffic from naughty Russian hackers who ruin your traffic and make the numbers totally useless. Accurate website analytics reveals *where* they leave, so you can fix it.
- **Your business goals aren't being tracked.** You can tell analytics to track when contact forms are submitted, orders are placed, or when PDFs are downloaded. Are you doing that? If so, are you improving your website based on that data?
- **Powerful hidden features aren't turned on.** You could be re-advertising to prospects who visited certain pages, at the flip of a switch. You could see what visitors search for, and learn what they're *really* looking for so you can offer it to them.
- **There's no way to see your top KPIs at-a-glance.** Business owners need simple top-line stats, but Google Analytics hides these in obscure places across many pages. There's a way to collect your main KPIs in one simple dashboard, which is great for sharing with your team as a PDF.

Google Analytics is a powerful tool for growth, and you're missing out on it.

When potential customers leave your website, it's money being left on the table.

This is a common problem. And that's a good thing!

You're going to be one of the few who solve this, and get accurate insights into how people use your website:

## I can set up your website analytics and give you actionable insights to grow your business.

Here's how I can help.

### Clear out fake traffic

Simple housekeeping will clean out those fake visits from Russian spam bots. I'll set up filters so you're only tracking real people who come to your site.

### Track business goals

Analytics Goals let you measure when a lead or sale comes through the site. My favourite part of this is how **you can see which marketing channels are bringing in those leads and sales** - and prove whether your digital marketing spend is giving you a good ROI.

There's two kinds of goals we track: your big-win **macro goals** like leads and sales, and **micro goals** like downloading PDFs or social media clicks.

### Unlock hidden Google Analytics features

I'll turn on all of Google Analytics' best hidden features. The best one gives you the option to target website visitors with banner advertising on *other* websites in the future. We call this [retargeting], and it's the most cost-effective adveritsing method available today.

### A customised KPI dashboard

Finally, I'll bring your most important KPIs and trend graphs into one simple dashboard. No more getting lost in all those complicated analytics pages; I'll give you an actionable dashboard to check in on and share with your team as a PDF.
