# Markdown Heading 1 Test

This text helps test the design of a page by demonstrating each available element. For example, this is a link and below is some more.

Don't know what Markdown is? See my guide.

For example, bold text can be important for emphasising important words. Or sometimes you will use italic text for emphasis or foreign words like lorem ipsum.

## This is a heading 2

A sub-header helps separate important themes. The main one is an H2, but with long passages it is useful to separate ideas with H3s and even more if necesseary.

### Heading 3: bulleted Lists

For example, we might introduce a bulleted list this way.

- This is a bulleted list
- Great for lists!
- Quick-fire ideas or links
- Perfect for skim readers
- There's another kind of list which is just as important.

### Heading 3: Numbers Lists

Sometimes you need to delcare steps in order.

1. You start with a number on each line
2. This denotes that items need to be completed in order
3. Not as common as bullets, but there’s a time and place for everything.
4. That's it!

### Heading 3: Block quotes

Sometimes you’ll quote something from another site, or just want to pull quotes out with special formatting. This is what it looks like:

> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s.

## Heading 2: Back to paragraphs

Here’s lots of text to get a feel for large paragraphs on the page.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..”, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
